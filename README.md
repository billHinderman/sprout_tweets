Sprout Tweets List
=============

1. Deviations from wireframe
---

#### Hierarchy of remove/complete
As discussed at the office, there isn't a clear hierarchy of removal/completion

#### Card layout 768px breakpoint
In order to fit comfortably on mobile screens, the column layout of the cards gets applied at 768px breakpoint.  Below this, tweet cards are treated as solitary entities with their own visual hierarchy.

#### Column labels show at 768px
To keep with responsive styles of tweets, column labels are only relevant at the 768px breakpoint.  Below this, they are hidden.

#### Summary section 960px breakpoint
Summary section, rather than sitting next to the tweets list (as per wireframe), takes up the full page width under a 960px breakpoint.  This is to allow for the tweets to retain their grid layout down to 768px without sacrificing screen space for the summary.
